# NYSE-Companies-Financial-Analysis

In this project, I have analyzed real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. I have drawn a subset of a large dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse) that contains historical financial data from the S&P 500 companies. I have used a smaller subset of the data for this project.

I used the Fundamentals.csv and Securities.csv files provided by Kaggle. The Fundamentals file provides the fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. The Securities file provided the industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index.

I have accomplished three tasks:
1. Analyzed the data, specifically for oil and gas companies and then created a short presentation to share my findings.
2. I have developed a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement.
3. I have created a simple Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios.
